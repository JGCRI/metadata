Metadata forms for use by the GCIMS community

## Description
This repository includes metadata XML forms that build upon a schema provided by [DataCite.org](https://schema.datacite.org/meta/kernel-4.3/).  These metadata are to be included with any data product to abide by our commitment to FAIR guiding principles for scientific data management and stewardship [Wilkinson et al. 2016](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618).  XML elements from DataCite templates are defined here:  [DataCite Documentaion](https://schema.datacite.org/meta/kernel-4.3/doc/DataCite-MetadataKernel_v4.3.pdf).
